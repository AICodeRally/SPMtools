## The Core Problem

Quotas drive behavior. But only if reps believe they're credible. When they don't, reps optimize for different signals: historical payouts, manager negotiations, or sandbagging. A quota that feels arbitrary gets ignored; one that feels fair gets chased.

Credibility comes from three sources:
1. **Capacity alignment** - "Can I actually hit this?"
2. **Consistency logic** - "Does this follow a clear pattern?"
3. **Transparent methodology** - "Do I understand how this was calculated?"

## Quota Setting Checklist

### Before You Set Quotas

- [ ] Do you have 12+ months of clean transaction data per rep?
- [ ] Have you segmented by territory complexity, deal size, customer type?
- [ ] Do you know your attainment distribution? (What % hit >100%? 50-100%? <50%?)
- [ ] Have you identified outliers - reps with structural advantages/disadvantages?
- [ ] Do you understand which variables drive individual rep performance?

### During Quota Setting

- [ ] Start with capacity (what can this territory actually produce?) not targets
- [ ] Apply market growth assumptions explicitly
- [ ] Build rep-by-rep from territory up (not top-down rollup)
- [ ] Create confidence bands (low, expected, high scenarios)
- [ ] Document your assumptions - make them visible to leadership

### After Quota Setting (Critical)

- [ ] Present methodology to reps - show them your logic
- [ ] Let them ask questions and flag their unique situations
- [ ] Have comp explain how quota connects to accelerators
- [ ] Track adherence - which reps hit quota consistently?
- [ ] Plan your adjustment strategy for 6-month mark

## Common Quota Mistakes

**"Let's use last year's number + X% growth"**
This assumes last year was credible (it might not be). This assumes growth is uniform (it's not). And it ignores structural changes (new competitors, product mix shift, market saturation).

**"We need to hit $X revenue, so let's divide by team size"**
This is top-down math. It answers "how much money do we need?" but not "what can this territory actually produce?" Top-down quotas almost never reflect reality.

**"Top performers should have higher quotas"**
Quota should reflect territory capacity, not rep skill. If you penalize your best reps by raising their quotas, they get demotivated or leave. (Reward them through comp plan design instead.)

**"We'll adjust mid-year if we're off track"**
Reps need certainty. Adjusting quotas mid-year signals you don't know what you're doing. Set them right the first time through better methodology.

**"Quotas should be aggressive so reps stretch"**
100% attainment should be achievable ~70% of the time. If you set quotas so high that <50% of reps hit them, you've set a bar for failure, not aspiration.

## The Credibility Test

Your quotas are credible if reps believe them. Test this:

1. **Ask 5 random reps**: "Is your quota fair?" Listen for "yes because..." vs. "no because..." The ones who give reasons are engaged. The ones who shrug have already decided it's arbitrary.

2. **Look at attainment variance**: If 80% of reps cluster between 90-110% quota, it's credible. If you have 20% hitting 50% and 10% hitting 200%, your quotas aren't aligned to reality.

3. **Track quota acceptance**: In planning, how many reps push back significantly? Some pushback is normal (10-20%). Heavy resistance (>40%) means your quotas aren't credible.

4. **Monitor quota gaming**: Are reps sandbagging at year-end? Accelerating deals artificially? If so, they don't believe the quota is stable.

## Related Actions

- Start with **Territory Design Best Practices** to ensure territory capacity is real
- Build clear **Accelerator Strategy** to reward exceeding quotas
- Create **Attainment Bands** for comp credibility (see Payout Curve Behavior Map)

## Questions to Ask Your Team

- What percentage of reps hit >90% of quota last year?
- Which reps have hit quota every year? Which haven't?
- What's the variance in quota attainment (highest vs. lowest)?
- Can you explain in one sentence why Territory A has quota $X and Territory B has $Y?
- Do reps believe their quotas are fair?
