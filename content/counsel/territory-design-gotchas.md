## Why Territory Design Matters

Territory design is the foundation of your comp plan. Get it wrong, and no accelerator strategy, quota methodology, or commission structure will fix it. Get it right, and a simple plan works beautifully.

The goal: Every rep has an equal opportunity to make their maximum comp.

Most organizations fail because they confuse equal territories with fair territories. They're not the same.

## The Seven Territory Design Gotchas

### 1. Balancing Revenue Instead of Capacity

**The mistake**: You create territories with $1M revenue each, assuming equal workload.

**Why it fails**: Revenue isn't the same as opportunity. A $1M territory with 3 enterprise accounts (each worth $300-400K, 6-month sales cycle) requires different effort than a $1M territory with 50 SMB accounts (each worth $20K, 1-month cycle). Same revenue, completely different difficulty.

**How to fix it**: Balance by capacity (number of accounts, weighted by size/complexity), not just revenue. Then adjust quotas if territories have different revenue-generating potential.

### 2. Creating "Crushed" and "Coasting" Territories

**The mistake**: Your territories have 30% variance in attainability. Some reps consistently exceed quota by 50%. Others always miss 20-30%.

**Why it fails**: Over time, your best reps move to the easy territories (or leave for companies with fair territories). You get stuck with mediocre reps in hard territories who demoralize the team.

**How to fix it**: Acceptable variance is 10-15% maximum. If you have a territory that produces $2M vs. one that produces $1.4M (from the same team type), redesign one of them.

### 3. Ignoring Account Transitions and Time Lags

**The mistake**: You assign a territory "as of January 1" and never adjust. An account transitions from growth to renewal. A key rep leaves and their territory is split. A new product is launched. Nothing changes in your territory design.

**Why it fails**: Reps optimize around transitions. They know accounts are moving, so they underinvest before the transition and overinvest after. You get lumpy results and reps playing games with timing.

**How to fix it**: Review territories every quarter. Adjust for account transitions. Have a clear policy on split credit when accounts move between reps. Make transitions explicit and manage them actively.

### 4. Account Overlap and Credit Confusion

**The mistake**: Multiple reps can claim credit for the same account. A rep's territory overlaps with three others. Customers call the wrong rep and get redirected.

**Why it fails**: Reps fight over accounts. Credit disputes become political. You get customer confusion and internal friction. And you can't track who really closed a deal.

**How to fix it**: One account = one owner. No overlap. Have a clear escalation path for account coverage needs. If the account needs multiple reps (enterprise), assign specific roles (enterprise rep, channel partner, implementation) with explicit credit rules.

### 5. Ignoring Competitive Intensity

**The mistake**: Your territories are balanced by account count and revenue, but Territory A is surrounded by 10 competitors and Territory B has 2.

**Why it fails**: Reps in competitive territories work harder for the same results. Reps in protected territories coast. Over time, you lose your good people from competitive territories.

**How to fix it**: Account for competitive intensity in territory design. Consider adjusting quota or comp plan design to reflect market difficulty. Or actively assign your best reps to hard territories (with compensation acknowledgment).

### 6. Static Territory Design in Dynamic Markets

**The mistake**: You design territories based on last year's market. New competitors appear. Customer churn spikes. Product mix shifts. Territory design never adjusts.

**Why it fails**: Territories that were fair last year are underwater this year. Reps get demoralized. You get blamed for bad comp design when the problem is bad territory design.

**How to fix it**: Build an annual review process. Assess: Did this territory produce what we expected? If not, why? Market change? Rep performance? Territory design? Adjust design accordingly.

### 7. Not Communicating the "Why" Behind Territory Design

**The mistake**: You redesign territories and announce the new assignments. You don't explain the logic behind the changes.

**Why it fails**: Reps assume you're moving them for political reasons. They fight the changes. They don't believe the new assignments are fair. And they don't have the context to forecast their compensation.

**How to fix it**: Present territory redesigns with methodology. Show the data: account lists, revenue by territory, capacity metrics, competitive analysis. Explain your balancing criteria. Let reps see why their territory is what it is.

## The Right Approach to Territory Design

1. **Inventory**: List every account with revenue, size, complexity, and product mix
2. **Segment**: Group by type (enterprise, mid-market, SMB) and complexity
3. **Balance**: Create territories with equal capacity and opportunity within each segment
4. **Validate**: Run the attainment test (would equal-skill reps have equal opportunity?)
5. **Communicate**: Show reps the methodology and underlying data
6. **Monitor**: Track territory performance and adjust quarterly
7. **Governance**: Have a clear process for account transitions and territory adjustments

## The Real Cost of Bad Territory Design

Bad territory design costs you:
- Turnover of your best reps (they leave for fair opportunities)
- Demotivation of reps in underwater territories
- Political battles over account assignments
- Compensation disputes that take leadership time
- Inability to forecast sales (reps optimize territory, not strategy)
- Compensation overpay to good reps and underpay to struggling ones

## Questions for Your Team

- Can you draw a map of your territories and explain why each rep owns what they own?
- What's the variance in opportunity across your territories?
- How often do you adjust territories? (Should be annually minimum)
- Do you have account overlap or conflict?
- Could a rep with average skills make the same comp in any territory, or are some much easier?
